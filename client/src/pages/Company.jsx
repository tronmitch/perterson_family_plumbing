      <h1>THE HISTORY OF PETERSON PLUMBING SUPPLY</h1>
      <p>
      Peterson Plumbing Supply is a locally owned family business. Don Peterson opened the first location in Richfield Utah in 1975. Coming from a family of plumbers he saw a need to open a supply house in the community. Forty years later, the company has grown to 6 locations across Utah with Don and his family still involved in the business. Petersonâ€™s focuses on residential and commercial plumbing, irrigation, hydronic heating, waterworks, industrial and HVAC markets. No job is too big or too small. Come see us at one of our locations for all of your plumbing needs. Our knowledgeable staff will be sure to get you the right material for the job in our heavily stocked warehouses. We have built good relationships with our vendors and sales representatives through the years to provide the information and products that you need. We have been in business for 40 years and look forward to 40 more.
